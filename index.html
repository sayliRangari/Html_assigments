        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <p><b>Coffee</b> is a beverage that is made from the roasted beans of coffee pods usually in a powdered form. The three types of coffee beans are Arabica, Robusta and a blend of the two. They are grown in parts of Africa, South America and Indian Peninsula.<b><i>The popular coffees on a menu are Espresso, Café Latte, Macchiato, Choc Latte, etc.</i></b> that may have added milk, or other ingredients like nutmeg.
        The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals.</p>


        <h2>Tea</h2>
        <p><b>Tea</b> is the most popular beverage in the world after water. It’s a simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the <b><i>Camellia sinensis plant.</b></i>
        Herbal teas are not made from the Camellia plant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas.
