            <p><em><b>A lunar eclipse</b></em> occurs when the Sun, Earth and Moon align so that the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the <b>umbra.</b>When the Moon is within the umbra, it will turn a reddish hue because of the little remaining sunlight being refracted through the atmosphere before it hits the lunar surface.If no light was able to reach the Moon, as often happens, it simply isn't visible from Earth <em>(that's called a New Moon).</em> This doesn't happen every time the Moon makes its monthly trip around our planet because the Moon’s orbit around Earth is inclined to Earth’s orbit around the Sun by approximately 5 degrees. Space is three-dimensional after all. Twice a month the Moon intersects the ecliptic (Earth’s orbital plane) at points called nodes. If the Moon is going from south to north in its orbit, it’s an ascending node. If the Moon is going from north to south, it’s a descending node. If the full Moon or New Moon sweeps close to one of these nodes, then an eclipse is inevitable.
